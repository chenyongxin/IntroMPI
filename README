Introduction to MPI and FEniCSx applications
--------------------------------------------

This is auxiliary material of my lecture at Tongji University, Dec 30, 2024.
I mainly focus on the big picture of MPI and some relevant applications with FEniCSx.
For better understanding, some comments in the code are mixed in Chinese and English.
As MPI and FEniCSx are introduced with Python in this lecture, I would suggest to 
create a conda environment with FEniCSx-v0.8.0, as
$ conda create -n fenicsx080
$ conda activate fenicsx080
$ conda install -c conda-forge fenics-dolfinx=0.8.0 mpich

To run code in parallel, for example
$ mpirun -n 3 python 05_interpolation_matrix.py
